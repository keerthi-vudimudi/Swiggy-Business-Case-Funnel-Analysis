# Swiggy-Business-Case-Funnel-Analysis
This holistic approach combines statistical rigor, data manipulation, and business strategy, making it an excellent exercise in applied data analytics.
This business case focuses on Swiggy, one of the largest food e-commerce platforms in India, where over 1 million users transact daily. As a growth and strategy analyst for Swiggy, the objective is to analyze the company's performance for the year 2019 using the "Funnel Case Study Data" workbook. This workbook consists of three worksheets:

Session Details Sheet: This sheet captures date-wise session counts, including listing sessions, menu sessions, cart sessions, payment sessions, and order sessions. Analyzing this data will help identify trends in user engagement and order volume.

Channel Wise Traffic Sheet: This sheet provides a breakdown of traffic (listing sessions) at a daily level, which helps assess the effectiveness of various traffic channels in driving user engagement.

Supporting Data Sheet: This sheet contains additional metrics at a date level, such as the number of operating restaurants, average discounts offered, out-of-stock items per restaurant, average packaging and delivery charges, cost for two, and the success rate of payments. This data is essential for understanding factors that might influence user behavior and overall performance.

# Objectives and Tasks
The primary tasks involve:

# Analyzing Order Trends: 
Identify the increase or decrease in the number of orders using the Session Details sheet. This includes filling in the remaining columns based on defined metrics, identifying peak and low order days compared to the same day the previous week, and focusing on significant changes (above 20% or below -20%).

# Traffic Analysis: 
Assess changes in traffic relative to the same day last week and identify the sources of any traffic changes using the Channel Wise Traffic sheet.

# Conversion Analysis: 
Evaluate changes in overall conversion rates compared to previous dates. This includes breaking down overall conversion into specific metrics (L2M, M2C, C2P, P2O) and identifying which conversions fluctuate. Hypotheses regarding potential causes for these fluctuations will be created and validated using the Supporting Data sheet.

Relevance to Data Analytics

This business case is a comprehensive application of data analytics techniques, integrating concepts from both statistics and business analysis. 
It emphasizes:

## Statistical Analysis: Understanding and interpreting trends, fluctuations, and comparisons using percentage changes, which are foundational concepts in statistics.

Case Study Approach: The analysis mimics real-world scenarios that analysts face in the industry, focusing on problem-solving and deriving insights from complex data sets.

## Excel and Data Visualization: The tasks involve data manipulation and visualization techniques, where tools like Excel can be used to organize data, create pivot tables, and generate visualizations to facilitate better decision-making.
